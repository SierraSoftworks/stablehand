# Stablehand
**A cleanup tool for Rancher servers**

Stablehand is a tool designed to keep your Rancher server in a nice, clean, maintanable
state under production conditions (read: when an autoscaling group is destroying your hosts).

It is intended to be run on a `cron` schedule to deactivate, remove and purge hosts which meet
certain conditions. You would, for example, run it with the following `crontab`.

```crontab
# Deactivate hosts which are in the reconnecting state every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * stablehand deactivate --agent-state=reconnecting

# Remove hosts which are in the inactive state on the hour
0 * * * * stablehand remove --state=inactive
```

## Docker

Stablehand is also available as a Docker image at `sierrasoftworks/stablehand`, allowing you to run this as a scheduled Docker container on your Rancher infrastructure for added-meta. When doing so, it may be easiest to use an environment file to hold your
config.

```
RANCHER_SERVER=https://localhost
RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY=abcdefg
RANCHER_SECRET_KEY=abcdefg
```

```
# Deactivate hosts which are in the reconnecting state
docker run --rm --env-file stablehand.env sierrasoftworks/stablehand stablehand deactivate --agent-state=reconnecting

# Remove hosts which are in the inactive state
docker run --rm --env-file stablehand.env sierrasoftworks/stablehand stablehand remove --state=inactive
```

## `man stablehand`
