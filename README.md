# Stablehand
**A cleanup tool for Rancher servers**

Stablehand is a tool designed to keep your Rancher server in a nice, clean, maintanable
state under production conditions (read: when an autoscaling group is destroying your hosts).

It is intended to be run on a `cron` schedule to deactivate, remove and purge hosts which meet
certain conditions. You would, for example, run it with the following `crontab`.

```crontab
# Deactivate hosts which are in the reconnecting state every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * stablehand deactivate --state reconnecting

# Remove hosts which are in the inactive state on the hour
0 * * * * stablehand remove --state inactive

# Purge hosts which are in the removed state at midnight
0 0 * * * stablehand purge --state removed
```

## `man stablehand`
