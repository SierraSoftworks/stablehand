# Stablehand [![Build Status](https://drone.sierrasoftworks.com/api/badges/SierraSoftworks/stablehand/status.svg)](https://drone.sierrasoftworks.com/SierraSoftworks/stablehand)
**A cleanup tool for Rancher servers**

Stablehand is a tool designed to keep your Rancher server in a nice, clean, maintanable
state under production conditions (read: when an autoscaling group is destroying your hosts).

It is intended to be run on a `cron` schedule to deactivate, remove and purge hosts which meet
certain conditions. You would, for example, run it with the following `crontab`.

```crontab
# Deactivate hosts which are in the reconnecting state every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * stablehand deactivate --agent-state=reconnecting

# Remove hosts which are in the inactive state on the hour
0 * * * * stablehand remove --state=inactive
```

## Docker

Stablehand is also available as a Docker image at `sierrasoftworks/stablehand`, allowing you to run this as a scheduled Docker container on your Rancher infrastructure for added-meta. When doing so, it may be easiest to use an environment file to hold your
config.

```
CATTLE_URL=https://localhost
CATTLE_ACCESS_KEY=abcdefg
CATTLE_SECRET_KEY=abcdefg
```

```
# Deactivate hosts which are in the reconnecting state
docker run --rm --env-file stablehand.env sierrasoftworks/stablehand stablehand deactivate --agent-state=reconnecting

# Remove hosts which are in the inactive state
docker run --rm --env-file stablehand.env sierrasoftworks/stablehand stablehand remove --state=inactive
```

### On Rancher
If you're running Stablehand on Rancher, you'll want to set the following labels to have Rancher automatically populate the `CATTLE_URL`,
`CATTLE_ACCESS_KEY` and `CATTLE_SECRET_KEY` environment variables.

```yml
labels:
    io.rancher.container.create_agent: 'true'
    io.rancher.container.agent.role: environment
```

A typical example for the `docker-compose.yml` on Rancher.

- You can add `restart: always` for the two services to let them continually be started again by Rancher after their process exited
- Use `scale: 1` for each of them in `rancher-compose.yml`

```yml
stablehand-deactivate-reconnecting:
  labels:
    io.rancher.container.pull_image: always
    io.rancher.container.start_once: 'true'
    io.rancher.container.create_agent: 'true'
    io.rancher.container.agent.role: environment
  entrypoint:
  - /stablehand
  command:
  - deactivate
  - --agent-state=reconnecting
  image: sierrasoftworks/stablehand
stablehand-remove-inactive:
  labels:
    io.rancher.container.pull_image: always
    io.rancher.container.start_once: 'true'
    io.rancher.container.create_agent: 'true'
    io.rancher.container.agent.role: environment
  entrypoint:
  - /stablehand
  command:
  - remove
  - --state=inactive
  image: sierrasoftworks/stablehand
```
